# Adapter Design Pattern, in Swift 3.0

This is a Structural Design Pattern

Inspired on [github ochococo/Design-Patterns-In-Swift](https://github.com/ochococo/Design-Patterns-In-Swift#-adapter)

The adapter pattern is used to provide a link between two otherwise incompatible types by wrapping the "adaptee" with a class that supports the interface required by the client.

I implemented a second example, the one present in [Design Patterns book by Head First](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do). An implementation in Java can be found in [github:adagio/javaAdapterDP](https://github.com/adagio/javaAdapterDP)
